Stats Scraper for Basketball-Reference.com

Version 1.0
===================
Statistics - how exciting.

This is a simple Python program to scrape data from basketball-reference.com for any player, active or retired, and for any season that basketball-reference.com has data for.

Currently supports the following data
-per game season stats (think field goals made, field goal attempts, FG%, free throws made/attempted, blocks, steals, opponents, home/away games, etc.) for regular season and playoffs
-shot data for different splits (regular season/playoffs, 2s/3s, distance away from rim, vs. different teams, games in different months, shot types, etc.)

See examples.py to see it in action
