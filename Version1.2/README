Stats Scraper for Basketball-Reference.com

Version 1.2 (11/11/2020)
===================
Fixed getPlayerList function to actually work. Now returns all players with last name starting with specified letter
as well as URL (mainly for the purpose of getting the player's BKRef identifier)

Version 1.1 (11/8/2020)
===================
In all functions, added a column to the returned Pandas Dataframe to report the year of the data (season end year).
Cleaned up some stray unused code laying around from 1.0


Version 1.0 (8/27/2020)
===================
Statistics - how exciting.

This is a simple Python program to scrape data from basketball-reference.com for any player, active or retired, and for any season that basketball-reference.com has data for.

Currently supports the following data
-per game season stats (think field goals made, field goal attempts, FG%, free throws made/attempted, blocks, steals, opponents, home/away games, etc.) for regular season and playoffs
-shot data for different splits (regular season/playoffs, 2s/3s, distance away from rim, vs. different teams, games in different months, shot types, etc.)

See examples.py to see it in action
